# Production Ready Machine Learning with Bento-ML

The goal of this chapter is to build and deploy an ML service, customize our service to fit our use case, and make our service production ready with the open-source library BentoML,
which is a library that packages components like code, model(s), data and dependencies into one
single deployable unit, called a "Bento".
Here are some of the topics covered by this chapter:

* Building & Deploying a Prediction Machine Learning Service
* Anatomy of a BentoML Service
* Customizing a Bento
* BentoML Production Deployment
* High Performance Serving
