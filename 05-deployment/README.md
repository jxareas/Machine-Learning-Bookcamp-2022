This is a chapter that covers model deployment: the process of putting models to use. In
particular, weâ€™ll see how to package a model inside a web service, so other services can use it.
We will also see how to deploy the web service to a production-ready environment.

Here are some of the topics covered by this chapter:

* Saving Models with **Pickle**
* Serving Models with **Flask**
* Managing dependencies with **Pipenv**
* Making a self-contained service using **Docker**
* Deploying the model to the cloud using **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

You can get the solutions as Jupyter Notebooks in [Deepnote][deployment_notebook] or take a look
at the [Flask App][flask_app].
