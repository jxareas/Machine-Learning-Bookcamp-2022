This is a chapter that explores the theme of Regression in Machine Learning.
All algorithms in this chapter are implemented manually, using Linear Algebra knowledge.

Here are some of the topics covered by this chapter:

* Doing **Exploratory Data Analysis** to discover patterns
* Using **Linear Regression** via the Normal Equation, to predict
quantitative target variables.
* Applying **Tikhonov Regularization** to a Linear Regression model.
* Using **random seeds** in order to control reproducibility

You can get the solutions as Jupyter Notebooks in [Deepnote][regression_notebook]
or as a [Python file][regression_script].
