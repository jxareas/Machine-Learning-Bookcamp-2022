This is a chapter that explores the theme of Classification in Machine Learning via the 
Logistic Regression Model.

Here are some of the topics covered by this chapter:
* Doing **exploratory data analysis** in order to identify important features
* **One-Hot Encoding** Categorical variables with `DictVectorizer` to use them in machine learning models
* Using **Logistic Regression** for Classification.


You can get the solutions as Jupyter Notebooks in [Deepnote][classification_notebook]
, as a [Python file][classification_script] or in the [Streamlit App][classification_streamlit].
