This is a chapter that covers how to use and interpret several metrics in the context of 
Classification.

Here are some of the topics covered by this chapter:

* **Accuracy** as a way of evaluating Binary Classification models and its limitations
* Determining where our model makes mistakes using a **Confusion Table**
* Deriving other metrics like **precision** and **recall** from the confusion table
* Using **ROC** (receiver operating characteristics) and **AUC** (area under the ROC curve) to further
understand the performance of a binary classification model
* **Cross-validating** a model to make sure it behaves optimally
* **Tuning the parameters** of a model to achieve the best predictive performance

You can get the solutions as Jupyter Notebooks in [Deepnote][evaluation_notebook]
or as a [Python file][evaluation_script].
