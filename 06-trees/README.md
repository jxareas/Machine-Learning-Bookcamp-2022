# Decision trees and Ensemble Learning

This chapter also covers binary classification problems, but using a different family
of machine learning models called *tree-based models*. Some models covered
by this chapter are: random forests and gradient boosting.

Here are some of the topics covered by this chapter:

* **Decision trees** and the decision tree learning algorithm
* **Random forest**: putting multiple trees together into one model
* **Gradient boosting** as an alternative way of combining decision trees

Solutions for this chapter are currently being worked on.
